summary: Control a squad of police to stop AI rioters from destryoying the city!
---

The city is in chaos as rioters run loose, destroying everything in their path! Strategically control your squad of police to deter, contain or otherwise incapacitate the rioters and keep the city safe.

Riotbusters is a game created with the Unity game engine as a team project for Advaced game development at Concordia University. The game contains elements of Real-Time Strategy (RTS) games and crowd simulation.

Spend public funds to power your police abilities such as the water cannon, rubber bullets, smoke grenade, lethal rounds and more. But be careful, using aggressive abilities whilst in view of the numerous reporters will lower your public perception and lower the amount of public funds available.
